"Navigate the News, Know the Truth: Your Personalized Fact-Checker in a Digital World."

This is Truth Hunter, and this repo contains the Jupyter Notebook explaining the code. Attempted to upload the sentence embeddings model here so I could set up a live demo to test out but was unable due to size constraints. So here is the link to directly download the sentence embedding model: (https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder). Also, please do remember to change the directory of the model in the second cell before attempting to run it. Hope you enjoy understanding the workings of the project as much as I did.
