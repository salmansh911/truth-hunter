"Navigate the News, Know the Truth: Your Personalized Fact-Checker in a Digital World."

This is Truth Hunter, and this repo contains the Jupyter Notebook explaining the code, along with the sentence embeddings model used. You may download the repo to try it out, but please make sure to change the directory of the sentence embeddings model in the code to the directory of where the sentence embeddings model is downloaded on your computer. Have a great day :)
